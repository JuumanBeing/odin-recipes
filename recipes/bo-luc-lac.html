    <p>Shaking Beef, or Bò Lúc Lắc, is a delicious Vietnamese dish of marbled cubes of beef tossed in all the good stuff: soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, a little sugar, butter, and black pepper. Everything gets shaken around in the wok to get a nice all-around sear, hence the name…Shaking Beef!</p>
    <p>It’s savory, balanced, and incredibly tasty. Serve it on a bed of lettuce, with sliced tomato and cucumber and some steamed rice, and you’re in for a delicious meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the beef and marinade:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1-1¼ pounds boneless ribeye (trimmed of any large pieces of excess fat and cut into 1 1/2-inch/4cm cubes)</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon palm sugar or brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon neutral oil (such as canola, vegetable, or avocado oil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For rest of the dish:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your preferred crunchy green lettuce (such as romaine, baby gem, or butter lettuce, washed and patted dry or run through a salad spinner)</li>
      <li>1 medium seedless cucumber (sliced)</li>
      <li>1 large tomato (thinly sliced and cut into half moons)</li>
      <li>1 lime (cut into wedges)</li>
      <li>1½ tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola, vegetable, or avocado oil; divided)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion (sliced into thin wedges)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl, add the beef cubes, garlic, palm sugar/brown sugar, cornstarch, black pepper, oyster sauce, fish sauce, light soy sauce, and neutral oil. Mix with your hands to evenly coat the beef.</li>
      <li>Cover with an overturned plate, refrigerate, and marinate overnight or at least 8 hours.</li>
      <li>When you&apos;re ready to cook the beef, first prepare your lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and lime.</li>
      <li>On a serving platter, add a bed of lettuce. Arrange sliced tomatoes and cucumbers on either side of the plate, and add the lime wedges around the perimeter of the plate.</li>
      <li>Heat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat until it&apos;s just smoking (or, in the case of a nonstick skillet, just heat it until hot).</li>
      <li>Add 1 tablespoon of oil, and sear the beef cubes for 5 minutes, tossing periodically to brown all sides.
      <li>Transfer the beef to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the onions and another ½ tablespoon of oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes. If the pan is getting dry, add a splash of water to deglaze it.</li>
      <li>Add the beef back to the wok, along with the dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, and finally the butter!</li>
      <li>Give everything a toss to combine until the sauce is coating the beef and onions.</li>
      <li>Transfer to your prepared serving platter, on top of your bed of lettuce, and serve with steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
