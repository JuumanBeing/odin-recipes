    <p>This dish highlights the combination of spicy, sour kimchi and rich, creamy cheese!</p>
    <p>Perhaps you&apos;ve seen cheesy kimchi recipes popping up around the internet. Perhaps you&apos;ve heard of kimchi grilled cheese sandwiches or cheesy kimchi ramen. Much like the combination of sauerkraut and swiss cheese on a reuben sandwich, the flavors of the fermented kimchi and salty, buttery cheese are the perfect counterpoints.</p>
    <p>This is the kind of dish that makes you want to curl up on the couch with your favorite K-drama playing in the background!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons neutral oil (such as vegetable, canola, or avocado oil, divided)</li>
      <li>½ cup finely chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 cup mushrooms (button, cremini, oyster, shiitake, chopped)</li>
      <li>¾ cup kimchi (coarsely chopped)</li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons kimchi juice</li>
      <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons gochujang</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese (or any good melting cheese; use more if you like)</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Chopped scallion (optional garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F/190°C.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Add the onion, and cook for 5 minutes, or until it begins to turn translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the mushrooms and cook for a few more minutes until tender.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat, and mix in the kimchi, kimchi juice, cooked rice, and gochujang until well-combined.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a small baking dish. Top evenly with shredded cheese. Bake for 12 – 15 minutes, until the cheese is lightly browned and bubbly.</li>
      <li>While the rice is baking, fry the eggs in 1 tablespoon of oil to serve with your kimchi rice bake.</li>
      <li>Garnish with chopped scallion and enjoy!</li>
